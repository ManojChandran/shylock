# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a command line tool in Go that reads JSON configuration files containing AWS resource specifications and calls AWS cost estimation APIs to provide cost calculations in dollar amounts. The tool will serve as a simple utility for developers and infrastructure teams to estimate costs before deploying AWS resources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run a command line tool with a JSON file input to get AWS cost estimates, so that I can understand infrastructure costs before deployment without complex AWS SDK setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs the CLI tool with a valid JSON file path THEN the system SHALL read the resource specifications and return cost estimates in dollar amounts
2. WHEN the JSON file contains valid AWS resource configurations THEN the system SHALL call the appropriate AWS cost estimation API
3. WHEN the AWS API returns cost data THEN the system SHALL display the results in a clear, readable format with dollar amounts
4. IF the JSON file is missing or malformed THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and exit gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the CLI tool to use my existing AWS credentials, so that I can authenticate with AWS services without additional configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool runs THEN the system SHALL use standard AWS credential chain (environment variables, AWS config files, IAM roles)
2. WHEN AWS credentials are valid THEN the system SHALL successfully authenticate with AWS cost estimation services
3. WHEN AWS credentials are invalid or missing THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message about authentication failure
4. IF AWS permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages about required permissions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an infrastructure engineer, I want to specify different AWS resources in a JSON file, so that I can get cost estimates for various infrastructure configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the JSON file contains EC2 instance specifications THEN the system SHALL calculate hourly, daily, and monthly costs
2. WHEN the JSON file contains storage service specifications THEN the system SHALL estimate costs based on storage size and type
3. WHEN the JSON file contains multiple resource types THEN the system SHALL provide individual and total cost breakdowns
4. IF a resource type is not supported THEN the system SHALL display a warning and continue with supported resources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the CLI tool to provide clear output and error handling, so that I can integrate it into automation scripts and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool completes successfully THEN the system SHALL exit with status code 0
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL exit with appropriate non-zero status codes
3. WHEN verbose mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL display detailed API call information
4. IF the tool encounters network issues THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and display progress

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cost analyst, I want the CLI tool to output detailed cost information in multiple formats, so that I can analyze and report on infrastructure costs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cost estimates are calculated THEN the system SHALL display costs in USD with appropriate precision
2. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL output results in JSON format for programmatic consumption
3. WHEN applicable THEN the system SHALL include regional pricing information and assumptions
4. IF cost estimates include time-based projections THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the time periods (hourly, daily, monthly)
